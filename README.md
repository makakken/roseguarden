## How to run roseguarden

### By using the release packages

* Download and unzip the latest release `roseguarden-X.Y.Z` [here](https://gitlab.com/roseguarden/roseguarden/-/releases) 
* Go to the folder and run the following commands in a terminal
    * Install the requirements with `pip3 -r requirements.txt`
    * Create a `config.ini` with your settings (see `config.template`) 
    * Run 'flask run'

### By cloning or forking the roseguarden repository

* Clone or fork https://gitlab.com/roseguarden/roseguarden 
* Have a look in the `backend` and `frontend` folder for details to setup your development enviroment
* run `backend` and `frontend` from your development environment (e.g. we use vs code)
    * start the backend with `flask run` out of the `backend` folder (see more datailed instructions below)
    * start the frontend with `npm run dev` out of the `frontend` folder
+ alternativly you can use the `script/pack.py`-script to build your own package and host it with an HTTP-server

### By using Docker for Development
* run `docker-compose up -d`
* change frontend/nuxt.config.js change proxy-targets to: target: http://backend:5000 for /api/v1 and /api/v1/log
* frontend is listening on localhost:3000
* backend is listening on localhost:8002 (e.g. for direct calls via insomnia)

:boom: **Note:** the first command is caching an `npm install` into a named docker volume, which is then used in docker-compose. If you change anything in package.json rerun the first command to update dependencies.

#### Run Backend after fresh clone:
* `cd backend`
* `python3 -m venv .venv`
* `. venv/bin/activate`
* (venv) `pip install Flask`
* (venv) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* (venv) `run flask`
